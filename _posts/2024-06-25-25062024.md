## **2.Detailed Progress Report**
### **2.1. Research and Experimentï¼ˆ40%ï¼‰**
- **Purpose:** As a STEM practitioner,this is a core part of the doctoral student's energy allocation, including experimental design, data collection, analysis and interpretation of results. Doctoral students are expected to devote considerable time to research on their topic, which is the foundation of their academic identity and career.
- **Advisory Boardï¼š**
  - Have a meeting with Prof.Khovanova Natasha;
  - I will have a meeting with Prof.Sai Gu and Prof.Xiaowei Zhao separately.
- **Matlab Tryingï¼š**
  - Learning to use simulink for the project;
  - Followed by 1st principle,what is needed by the real world? Porblem statement,then your solution.Fast!
  - Build the Matlab model followed by the tutorial provided by Matlab.Matlab is much more powerful compared with Aspen Plus.
- **Aspen Simulationï¼š**
  - Learning to use Aspen Plus for the project;


### **2.2. Learning and Trainingï¼ˆ30%ï¼‰**
- **Time Investment:** 20 hours.
  - **Focus:** Preparing a new research proposal and participating in a training camp on transfer learning skills.
- **IEEE Learning**
  - Meeting with Jiawei Wang,Richard Liu and Yinbo Hu to have a discussion about IEEE. 
  - Will register to be a IEEE fellow.



### **2.3. Administration & Businessï¼ˆ20%ï¼‰**
- **Purpose:** As a STEM practitioner, engaging in political and business activities aims to secure resources and support, understand and shape norms and policies, uphold ethics and social responsibility, and foster commercial and interdisciplinary collaborations, thereby enhancing societal well-being through scientific progress.
- **New Accommodation**
  - **Time:** 5 hours of 40 hours for the week.
  - **Activities:** Discussions with Kerrie and the Wellbeing team on securing safe and suitable accommodation.
- **TSu Energy**
  - **Updates:** Development based on industrial needs. TSu Spotlights and a new channel, TSu Record, have been successfully launched.
- **Germany/US Visa**
  - **Progress:** Applications for both visas submitted, including arrangements for health insurance in Germany.
  - **Next Steps:** Pass the visa to the US embassy after receiving the passport.
- **Total Time Investment:** 20 Hours
