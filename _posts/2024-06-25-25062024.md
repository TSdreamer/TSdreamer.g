## 1.Key Achievements(Working Hours: 38)
### Time Management Strategies:
- **Total Working Hours**: 38 hours
- **Daily Allocation**: Aim to keep average daily working hours under 8 to ensure efficiency and prevent burnout.
- **Key Task Allocation**: Schedule critical tasks like meetings and visa application early in the week to allow ample time for any follow-up required.
- **Learning and Development**: Position learning activities towards mid to end of the week to focus after handling urgent and important administrative tasks.
