## Research Progress


1. **Paper 2: Component Level**
The paper describes the development and optimization of Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) through a novel approach of data augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Gaussian blur techniques. This research addresses the challenge of limited dataset sizes in laboratory settings by deconstructing the water electrolyzer into components and representing them in a binary data matrix, which includes over one thousand datasets and nearly forty thousand data points. Machine learning algorithms are employed to predict membrane electrode assembly performance, with the random forest algorithm achieving a high prediction accuracy reflected by a regression accuracy \(R^2\) of 0.83 at 1.8V potential. This approach aims to reduce the power-specific cost and increase the efficiency, reliability, and durability of PEMWEs, moving beyond the traditional reliance on expert experience and trial-and-error experiments. The integration of artificial intelligence is highlighted as a potential means to better support the water electrolysis industry, especially in capturing the growing opportunities for the integration of renewable energy sources, storing fluctuating energy, and supporting efficient power system operations.

: Based on emissions data for 182 Chinese cities from 2010, I provided PhD student with datasets and algorithms for carbon calculation research. This mentorship, offering access to emissions data and analytical methods, aims to enhance their ability to conduct environmental assessments. This effort advances their research skills and contributes to understanding urban emissions, supporting effective carbon management and sustainability strategies.
